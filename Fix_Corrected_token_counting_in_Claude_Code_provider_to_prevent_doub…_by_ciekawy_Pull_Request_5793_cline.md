### Related Issue

**Issue:** [#5792](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/5792)

### Description

The Claude Code provider was incorrectly overwriting token counts instead of accumulating them across multiple assistant messages within a single response stream. This caused significantly inflated token usage reporting, with Cline displaying much higher context usage than actual consumption.

**The fix** restores proper token accumulation logic by reverting to using `+=` operators instead of `=` for all token count fields (`inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`, `cacheWriteTokens`).

### Test Procedure

**Testing approach:**

-   Used the `ccusage` CLI tool to measure actual token consumption by Claude Code
-   Compared Cline's reported context usage against actual CLI usage
-   Tested both before and after the fix across multiple conversation turns

**Results:**

-   **Before fix**: Cline reported significantly inflated token counts compared to actual usage
-   **After fix**: Token counts match `ccusage` measurements exactly
-   Token deltas between requests now align perfectly with CLI measurements

**Confidence:** The fix has been validated to ensure accurate token reporting that matches the underlying CLI's actual consumption.

### Type of Change

-   [x]  üêõ Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
-   [ ]  ‚ú® New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
-   [ ]  üí• Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
-   [ ]  ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor Changes
-   [ ]  üíÖ Cosmetic Changes
-   [ ]  üìö Documentation update
-   [ ]  üèÉ Workflow Changes

### Pre-flight Checklist

-   [x]  Changes are limited to a single feature, bugfix or chore (split larger changes into separate PRs)
-   [ ]  Tests are passing (`npm test`) and code is formatted and linted (`npm run format && npm run lint`)
-   [ ]  I have created a changeset using `npm run changeset` (required for user-facing changes)
-   [ ]  I have reviewed [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Screenshots

Not applicable - backend token counting fix with no UI changes.

### Additional Notes

A separate investigation revealed up to ~20k token overhead between Claude Code and direct Anthropic API providers. This appears to be related to how the Claude Code CLI handles caching and session management. This overhead remains unaddressed by this fix and may warrant future investigation.

___

Important

Fixes token counting in `ClaudeCodeHandler` by changing assignment to accumulation for token fields, ensuring accurate usage reporting.

-   **Behavior**:
    -   Fixes token counting in `ClaudeCodeHandler` in `claude-code.ts` by changing `=` to `+=` for `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`, and `cacheWriteTokens`.
    -   Ensures token counts accumulate across multiple assistant messages instead of being overwritten.
-   **Testing**:
    -   Validated using `ccusage` CLI tool to compare reported and actual token usage.
    -   Confirmed accurate token reporting post-fix.

LGTM beyond the `nit` comment. Having tests would be great, but considering I only wrote tests for the `run` logic, I think it's beyond the scope of this PR. They are more than welcome if you have the time to do it. Otherwise, I will do so in a later PR.  
I tested it locally and confirmed the usage aligns with the usage reported by `ccusage`.

Thank you for your contribution!
